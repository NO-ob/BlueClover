### Download APK: [ [latest release](https://github.com/nnuudev/BlueClover/releases/latest) | [all releases](https://github.com/nnuudev/BlueClover/releases) ]

Blue Clover is a fast Android app for browsing 4chan on Android. It adds inline replying, thread watching, notifications, themes, filters and a whole lot more. Blue Clover is licensed under the GPL and will always be free.

The app is based on [Clover-dev 3.0.2 0e32fb7](https://github.com/chandevel/Clover/commit/0e32fb74d5ea4fbfe3248e559e64037bdf9acf17) and some of its more relevant [changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nnuudev/BlueClover/dev/CHANGES.txt) are:

- *New captcha support!*
- Page counter on thread view
- Board flags support
- Quick external image attaching
- Image renaming and reencoding
- Immersive mode for image gallery
- External archive support [partial]
- Alternate layout mode [experimental]

Some parts of the code were backported from [Kuroba](https://github.com/Adamantcheese/Kuroba) or merged from old [pull requests](https://github.com/chandevel/Clover/pulls?q=is%3Apr), check the [commit log](https://github.com/nnuudev/BlueClover/commits/dev) for proper attribution when applicable.

> *The goal of Blue Clover is to add some extra features to Clover while maintaining compatibility with Android 4.4. It is being distributed with the hope that it will be useful, but it is not meant as a replacement for any existing app. If you are interested in a more professional imageboard browser, please check [KurobaEx](https://github.com/K1rakishou/Kuroba-Experimental), or just [contribute to the original Clover](https://github.com/chandevel/Clover).*
